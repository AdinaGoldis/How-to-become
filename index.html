                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more
                customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone,
                I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers
                (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was
                just something nice and did not solve any problem.
